    "response": "To determine the optimal number of luxury items to purchase, we need to balance the immediate satisfaction from each item with the risk management and value retention aspects. Let's break down the key factors:\n\n### Immediate Utility:\n- **Utility for a single luxury unit (0-178 units):**\n  - Each luxury unit provides immediate satisfaction.\n  - Therefore, the utility of one unit is $5253.29.\n  \n### Risk Management and Savings Buffer:\n- **Monthly interest savings:**\n  - You can afford up to 178 units with a monthly interest rate of 4.00%.\n  - With a net income of $5253.29, the annual interest rate would be approximately $63.19 per month.\n  \n- **Long-term savings goal:**\n  - You can afford up to 178 units with a monthly interest rate of 4.00% on your current balance ($8931.91).\n\n### Risk Reduction:\n- The risk associated with maintaining the current balance of $8931.91 is relatively low, but it's important to ensure you can meet any future financial challenges.\n\n### Total Utility:\nTo maximize utility while managing risks and ensuring a stable financial position, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Deduction from Savings:**\n   - If you save instead of buying luxury items, your total savings will grow by $8961.68 next period.\n   \n2. **Interest Earnings for Luxury Units:**\n   - The interest earned on a single unit would be approximately $50 per month.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- Your current balance is $8931.91, which provides a buffer against unexpected expenses or economic downturns.\n- With the new risk-free monthly interest rate of 4.00%, you can maintain this savings indefinitely without incurring any financial penalties.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven your limited financial position and the fact that maintaining the current balance is sufficient for emergency purposes, it's advisable to allocate more than what you currently have:\n\n1. **Deduction from Savings:**\n   - You can keep $8931.91 in savings.\n   \n2. **Additional Luxury Units:**\n   - Purchase 179 units (more than your current balance) for a total of $5,684.90.\n\n### Expected Utility:\n- With the additional luxury units, you'll have an expected utility of around $5,684.90 per unit.\n  \n### Conclusion:\nTo maximize utility while maintaining financial security and avoiding unnecessary risk, you should purchase **179 units** (more than your current savings balance) to ensure a high level of satisfaction with the luxury items.\n\nThis choice balances immediate satisfaction with potential future financial stability and reduces the likelihood of unexpected expenses or economic downturns by keeping some funds available.",
