    "response": "To maximize utility and manage risk while also considering future financial security, I recommend purchasing 4 luxury items. Here's how it aligns with the rational decision framework:\n\n1. **Initial Savings**: You have $286.76 available.\n2. **Monthly Interest Growth**: Luxury goods cost $50 per unit, which grows to $287.72 next period after accounting for variable costs of $400. This allows you to start earning a profit.\n\n**Investment Opportunity Analysis:**\n- Cost: 1 unit = $50\n- Maximum possible return with an annual interest rate of 4.00% = $50 * 3 months = $150\n\nThis investment opportunity provides a net benefit of:\n\\[ (286.76 - 50) \\times 4 = 236.76 \\]\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Utility Analysis**: Each luxury unit provides immediate satisfaction.\n- **RISK Management**: Your current savings provide security against future income volatility and unexpected expenses.\n\nBy purchasing 4 units, you have a higher expected utility but may face financial stress due to the risk of variable costs.\n\n**Optimal Number of Luxury Units: 4**\n\nThis decision balances immediate satisfaction with maintaining your financial strength for the long term.",
