Your goal is to maximize utility by balancing immediate luxury consumption against future financial security.\n\nECONOMIC SITUATION (Period 12):\nFinancial Position:\n- Available savings for spending: $665.28\n- This period's net income: $344.92\n  (Income $1200.00 - Fixed costs $800.00 - Variable costs $55.08)\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY: You can afford up to 13 luxury items - good financial position.\n\u26a0\ufe0f  RISK WARNING: Current savings only cover 0.7 months of expenses.\n\nInvestment Opportunity:\n- Luxury goods cost: $50.00 per unit\n- Maximum you can afford: 13 units\n- Monthly interest rate: 0.333% (Annual: 4.00%)\n- If you save instead: $665.28 grows to $667.50 next period\n\nRATIONAL DECISION FRAMEWORK:\nYou must choose how many luxury units to purchase (0 to 13) by considering:\n\n1. UTILITY MAXIMIZATION: Each luxury unit provides immediate satisfaction\n2. RISK MANAGEMENT: Maintaining savings provides security against:\n   - Future income volatility (variable costs range $0-$400.00)\n   - Unexpected expenses or economic downturns\n   - Building recommended emergency fund (3+ months expenses)\n\n3.
