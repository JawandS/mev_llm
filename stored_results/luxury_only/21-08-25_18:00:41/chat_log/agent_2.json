Your goal is to maximize utility by balancing immediate luxury consumption against future financial security.\n\nECONOMIC SITUATION (Period 12):\nFinancial Position:\n- Available savings for spending: $10157.03\n- This period's net income: $1944.82\n  (Income $3200.00 - Fixed costs $1200.00 - Variable costs $55.18)\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY: You can afford up to 203 luxury items - good financial position.\n\nInvestment Opportunity:\n- Luxury goods cost: $50.00 per unit\n- Maximum you can afford: 203 units\n- Monthly interest rate: 0.333% (Annual: 4.00%)\n- If you save instead: $10157.03 grows to $10190.89 next period\n\nRATIONAL DECISION FRAMEWORK:\nYou must choose how many luxury units to purchase (0 to 203) by considering:\n\n1.
