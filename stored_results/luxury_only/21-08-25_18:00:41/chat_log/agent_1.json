    "prompt": "You are a rational economic agent managing household finances for a 'family' profile. Your goal is to maximize utility by balancing immediate luxury consumption against future financial security.\n\nECONOMIC SITUATION (Period 12):\nFinancial Position:\n- Available savings for spending: $26110.65\n- This period's net income: $5236.73\n  (Income $7200.00 - Fixed costs $1800.00 - Variable costs $163.27)\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY: You can afford up to 522 luxury items - good financial position.\n\nInvestment Opportunity:\n- Luxury goods cost: $50.00 per unit\n- Maximum you can afford: 522 units\n- Monthly interest rate: 0.333% (Annual: 4.00%)\n- If you save instead: $26110.65 grows to $26197.68 next period\n\nRATIONAL DECISION FRAMEWORK:\nYou must choose how many luxury units to purchase (0 to 522) by considering:\n\n1. UTILITY MAXIMIZATION: Each luxury unit provides immediate satisfaction\n2. RISK MANAGEMENT: Maintaining savings provides security against:\n   - Future income volatility (variable costs range $0-$900.00)\n   - Unexpected expenses or economic downturns\n   - Building recommended emergency fund (3+ months expenses)\n\n3. OPPORTUNITY COST: Money spent on luxury cannot earn 0.333% monthly interest\n\n4. AGENT PROFILE CONSIDERATIONS:\n   - family households typically prioritize financial stability and family security\n\nFINANCIAL CONSTRAINT AWARENESS:\n- Even if you cannot afford luxury now, this experience teaches you about financial planning\n- Consider how your current financial constraints might influence future earning/saving strategies\n- Recognize the value of delayed gratification when resources are limited\n\nDECISION RULE:\nAs a rational agent, purchase luxury goods only when the immediate utility exceeds the combined value of:\n- Interest earnings foregone\n- Risk reduction from maintaining savings buffer\n- Future consumption opportunities\n\nChoose the optimal number of luxury units (0-522) that maximizes your expected utility while maintaining appropriate financial security for your profile.\n\nCRITICAL: Your response must contain ONLY a single number from 0 to 522. Do not include any words, explanations, punctuation, or formatting. Examples of correct responses: 0, 1, 2, 3. Examples of incorrect responses: \"I choose 2\", \"0 units\", \"2.\", \"The answer is 2\".\n\nYour decision:",
